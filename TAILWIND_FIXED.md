# ✅ Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI Fixed!

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue:** Website was loading without Tailwind CSS styling - components weren't styled with ShadCN UI.

**Root Cause:** You had **Tailwind CSS v4** installed, which:
- Uses a completely different configuration system
- Is incompatible with ShadCN UI (which requires Tailwind v3)
- Had the wrong PostCSS configuration

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Downgraded Tailwind CSS**
```bash
# Removed v4
npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss

# Installed v3 (compatible with ShadCN)
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.1 postcss@^8.4.35 autoprefixer@^10.4.18
```

### 2. **Fixed PostCSS Configuration**
**Before:** (Tailwind v4 syntax)
```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
```

**After:** (Tailwind v3 syntax)
```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### 3. **Cleared Build Cache**
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```

## 🔍 Why Tailwind v4 Didn't Work

### Tailwind CSS v4 Changes:
- Uses new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Different configuration format
- Breaking changes from v3
- Not yet fully supported by ShadCN UI

### ShadCN UI Requirements:
- Requires Tailwind CSS v3.x
- Uses v3 configuration format
- Depends on v3 class system
- Expects PostCSS with Tailwind + Autoprefixer
